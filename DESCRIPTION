Description: Visualisation and construction of trade-off functions for
    f-differential privacy (f-DP) as introduced by Dong et al. (2022)
    <doi:10.1111/rssb.12454>. Includes Gaussian differential privacy, the f-DP
    generalisation of (epsilon,delta)-differential privacy and allows user
    specification of optimal type I and type II errors from which the lower
    convex hull trade-off function is automatically constructed.
